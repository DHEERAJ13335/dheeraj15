  <h3>Salute to our frontline warriors</h3>
  <p>The coronovirus outbreak has brought the world to stand stillwith business around the world shutting,the economytaking a severe hit and most countries being in lockdown all of us are fighting covid-19 in the best way we can. However, in this Pandemic, the medical community including doctors,nurses and the medical staff are the warriors who are fighting this disease on the frontline and are putting their lives at risk to keep us safe. Healthcare workers cannot shelter in place with their loved ones. They are not 6 feet away from their patients. They put themselves at risk every single shift. When they go home, they worry about exposing their families. The unsung heroes of the nation are being thanked in different ways. Thank you to the paramedics, midwifes nurses and doctors, overwhelmed and under resourced even before the public health emergency denoted in your hospitals and ambulances. Thank you to those who produce and deliver food and the essential goods , thank you to those who keep our transport system operating preventing the collapse of nation’s infrastructure. When everybody is sitting home, the delivery boys, the policemen, the doctors, nurses etc., are working in order to contain the corona virus. These people are corona warriors.
  </p>
  <p>Despite of all this, they continue to provide the highest level of care possible. Their dedication is true
inspiration.It’s so important that we don’t take coronavirus medical staff and essentials workers for granted as the
battle on the frontlines of the global pandemic. Thank you so much to all the frontliners who helped and served the nation.
